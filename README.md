## ⚙️ Understanding the Outputs

- **Accuracy**: Measures how often the model is correct.
- **Precision**: Indicates the correctness of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Shows how many actual positive cases were captured by the model.
- **ROC-AUC**: Represents the performance of the model across different thresholds.

Each metric will help you assess how well the model predicts customer churn.
